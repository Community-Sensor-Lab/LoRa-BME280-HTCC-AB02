# LoRa-BME280-HTCC-AB02 

Heltec HTCC-AB02 LoRaWAN with two BME280 for Rooftop Material Analysis with Architecture 

Welcome. This page is still being built at the moment. We will try to answer any questions given to us. 

## Hardware: 
The BME 280 is sensors capable of measuring **TEMPERATURE**, **HUMIDITY**, and **BAROMETRIC PRESSURE**. 

Connected to the **HTCC-AB02**, built by Heltec Automation, part of their CubeCell Series. They are specifically built to be used with the Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LoRaWan). 

Data measured from the BME280 sensors are sent to The Things Stack using LoRaWan 
Inclusion of a webhook in The Things Network to connect and send the gathered data to our Google Sheets.
